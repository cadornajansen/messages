# I can't be productive without you

Babe, before I met you pa, I myself was a procrastinator na, I was always lazing off, nights full of deep thoughts, longing for companionship, I've always been alone. But with you. I feel like I can anything, I face everything, I gained self-esteem. You helped me softened my feelings, you gave me the hugs I needed. I would trade everything just to get back your goodmornings and goodnights again. Here I am late at night, still up. I miss you and I always will. I hope you would still let me talk to you po, as long as I can express myself to you. Kahit gaano kaminsan mong basahin o tignan mga chats. Babe miss ko na yung playfulness mo, miss ko na the way you cling to me. I wanna shower you with all my love :(, I wanna buy you a bouquet of orchids, I wanna bring you to a garden of butterflies, I wanna eat sweets with you, I wanna take more pictures with you, I wanna hug you longer, I wanna be a better person for you. I wanna show my love babe kahit at the smallest ways nalang po :( it's so hard to be like this po, I know you got tired po, but we can take breaks po, let me show my love pa rin, let me be just here kahit konting sandali lang po, let me show you the love you deserve babe :(( Miss na miss na miss na kita Jhaizen ko
