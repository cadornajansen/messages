# I think about you palagi po

It's 5:27pm, I just got home, and while walking I still think about us, the first time I walked you home, I see our past wherever I go, if you wanna come back, my arms are still open, I still want to be with you, I hope you're okay na because you cried last night, but that night after the call, I realized how much I cried endlessly every night and I hope you can talk to me, then I remembered I no longer have anyone to reach out, but when you said you wanted to call I immediately replied as soon as the notification pops up, you're still my baby, and I don't want you to feel lonely and alone, no matter what I feel, I will always love you, it's been a week but I'm still hoping you'd coming even tho it seems impossible na, pero kahit ganito, mahirap pa rin, masakit pa rin, na hindi kita makalimutan, I'll still keep trying to be okay, I hope you're happy with your friends and I love you so much.
