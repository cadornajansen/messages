It's 11:47PM. I'm still griefing. I'm struggling to face the fact that my relationship is not coming back :(( even though I'm ready and waiting for her anytime.
We're not taking a break, she's not coming back, and I know really love her. When I told her I'm not sure whether to convert. I was taking my time 
to build my decision, for my family, but I was ready to commit, I know if it's her, I can do it. God knows I've always wanted one love in my lifetime, and a love that lasts until my death.
Every sad songs reminds me of our memories, I wonder how she can be okay :((. I wish I also had the support system she has. Because life is so ironic, I stayed when she
had no friends when we we're grade 11, and I helped her to be strong and confident that everything will be okay. But now look at me, didn't made any friends,
didn't build any meaningful connections. I'm kind of dissappointed dedicating every minute of my life to her that I forgot to build my own garden. But I don't regret
every minute of love spent on her. If this is heartbreak, it scares me. How can it be this painful. It's so painful it made me pray all the time.
