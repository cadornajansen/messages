I thought I was gonna be okay, but the pain keeps stinging. It appears then disappears again. I still keep questioning myself the same questions. Was it really necessary for us to separate? We could’ve just taken a break. I love her so much that it’s still so painful. I miss us, how we are to each other. I wanna tell her to come back, I wanna tell her how much I love her. I miss her so much. It feels like I lost a piece of me. I’m going numb again.

I keep wishing I could turn back time. I miss her so much that it’s the 4th night I’ve been dreaming about her, even when I take naps. I still do. I’m still willing to give her all my love. What would it take just to take back the love of my life? I really want her and I don’t think I’ll ever be okay. I love you, Jhaizen ko.
